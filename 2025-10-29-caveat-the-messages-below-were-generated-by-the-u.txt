> explain the honeycomb tools to me 

⏺ The Honeycomb MCP server provides tools for querying and analyzing your
  observability data. Here's a breakdown of the available tools:

  Discovery & Context

  get_workspace_context
  - Starting point - shows your team, environments, and default datasets
  - Use this first to understand what's available

  get_environment
  - Details about a specific environment including its datasets and calculated fields
  - Paginated (up to 500 datasets at a time)

  get_dataset
  - Complete dataset details: schema, columns with metadata, calculated fields
  - Returns up to 500 columns per page

  get_dataset_columns
  - Lists columns with sample values for a dataset
  - Can show all columns ever written, or just recent ones (last 7 days)

  Search & Discovery

  find_columns
  - Search for relevant columns across datasets using keywords
  - Helps you discover what data is available before building queries

  find_queries
  - Searches query history and saved queries based on your intent
  - Returns query specifications and run PKs you can use to fetch results

  Querying Data

  run_query
  - Main query tool for time-series data aggregation
  - Supports filters, breakdowns, calculations (COUNT, AVG, percentiles, etc.)
  - Returns results with a temporary authenticated URL for JSON download
  - Output formats: ASCII (formatted tables) or JSON

  get_query_results
  - Fetches results from a previously executed query
  - Accepts Honeycomb URL, query run PK, or query ID

  get_trace
  - Retrieves all spans for a specific trace ID in CSV format
  - View modes: auto, compact, full, or focused (on specific span)
  - Can limit depth and optionally include span events

  run_bubbleup
  - Analyzes what makes a subset of data different from baseline
  - Compares value distributions across columns to find significant differences

  Boards & Alerts

  list_boards / create_board
  - List existing boards or create new ones
  - Add queries, SLOs, and text panels to boards

  get_triggers
  - Lists configured triggers/alerts for the team

  Recommended Workflow

  1. Start with context: get_workspace_context → get_environment →
  get_dataset_columns
  2. Validate columns: Use find_columns to discover relevant columns before querying
  3. Query: Use run_query with validated column names
  4. Analyze: Use get_trace for specific traces or run_bubbleup for anomaly analysis

  The key principle: always validate column names exist before using them in queries
  - queries will fail if you reference non-existent columns.

> lets explore some of the data to understand the tools better 

⏺ Great idea! Let's start by getting the workspace context to see what data is
  available.
  ⎿  HONEYCOMB WORKSPACE CONTEXT                                                    
     ============================
     … +29 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I can see you have two environments:
  1. mylinks - 2 datasets
  2. obs-playground - 4 datasets (this likely contains data from your current
  project)

  Let me explore the obs-playground environment to see what datasets are available:

⏺ honeycomb - get_environment (MCP)(environment_slug: "obs-playground")
  ⎿  Environment: obs-playground (obs-playground)                                   

     DATASETS (1/1, 4 total)
     … +9 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Excellent! The four datasets correspond to your services:
  - graphql-server
  - nextjs-app
  - express-server
  - unknown_metrics

  Let's look at what columns are available in the express-server dataset to see what
  kind of telemetry data is being captured:

⏺ honeycomb - get_dataset_columns (MCP)(environment_slug: "obs-playground", dataset_slug:
                                        "express-server")
  ⎿ # Page: 1 | Items per page: 1000 | Total items: 117 | Total pages: 1 | Has next 
    page: false | Has previous page: false | All columns: false | Dataset: express-s
    erver | Environment: obs-playground
    … +122 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


⏺ Wow! The express-server dataset has 117 columns capturing a lot of interesting
  telemetry:

  Business Metrics:
  - Shopping list data (cost, items, out-of-stock info)
  - Nutrition information (calories, protein, carbs, fat)
  - Inventory levels (stock status, quantities)
  - Meal planning metrics
  - Batch operations

  Standard OpenTelemetry:
  - HTTP details (method, status, routes, user-agent)
  - Error tracking (exception types, messages, stacktraces)
  - Performance (duration_ms)
  - Service metadata (host, process, runtime info)

  Let me run a few queries to show you what kinds of insights you can get. Let's
  start with a simple query to see HTTP endpoint performance:

⏺ honeycomb - run_query (MCP)(environment_slug: "obs-playground", dataset_slug:
                             "express-server", query_spec:
                             {"calculations":[{"op":"COUNT"},{"op":"AVG","column":"durati
                             on_ms"},{"op":"P95","column":"duration_ms"}],"breakdowns":["
                             http.route"],"time_range":604800,"limit":10}, output_format:
                              "ascii")
  ⎿ ┌──────────────────┬───────┬──────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┐
    │ AVG(duration_ms) │ COUNT │ P95(duration_ms) │ http.route                     │
    ├──────────────────┼───────┼──────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
    … +542 lines (ctrl+o to expand)




⏺ Perfect! This shows the performance of your Express endpoints over the last 7 days.
   Key insights:

  - Shopping list generation is the slowest (41ms avg, 108ms p95) - makes sense since
   it orchestrates multiple calls
  - Nutrition lookups are fastest (0.5ms avg) - probably in-memory
  - 2,041 total requests across all endpoints

  Now let's query some of the business-specific metrics. Let's look at shopping list
  operations to see the custom attributes you're capturing:

⏺ honeycomb - run_query (MCP)(environment_slug: "obs-playground", dataset_slug:
                             "express-server", query_spec:
                             {"calculations":[{"op":"COUNT"},{"op":"AVG","column":"shoppi
                             ng_list.total_cost"},{"op":"AVG","column":"shopping_list.tot
                             al_items"},{"op":"COUNT","column":"shopping_list.has_out_of_
                             stock"}],"filters":[{"column":"http.route","op":"=","value":
                             "/shopping-list/generate"}],"time_range":604800},
                             output_format: "ascii")
  ⎿ ┌───────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┬───────┬──────
    ─────────────────────────────────┐
    │ AVG(shopping_list.total_cost) │ AVG(shopping_list.total_items) │ COUNT │ COUNT
    … +136 lines (ctrl+o to expand)



⏺ Nice! This shows that shopping lists average $28.60 in total cost with 8.64 items,
  and 11 out of 240 requests had out-of-stock items.

  Let's try one more interesting query - let's look at errors and see what's been
  failing:

⏺ honeycomb - run_query (MCP)(environment_slug: "obs-playground", dataset_slug:
                             "express-server", query_spec:
                             {"calculations":[{"op":"COUNT"}],"filters":[{"column":"error
                             ","op":"=","value":true}],"breakdowns":["exception.type","ht
                             tp.route"],"time_range":604800,"limit":10}, output_format:
                             "ascii")
  ⎿  ┌───────┬────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐                           
     │ COUNT │ exception.type │ http.route              │
     ├───────┼────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
     … +102 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Found errors! 354 total error spans, with 88 Error exceptions in
  /shopping-list/generate. Now let's demonstrate the trace lookup feature. Let me
  find a trace ID from a recent error:

⏺ honeycomb - run_query (MCP)(environment_slug: "obs-playground", dataset_slug:
                             "express-server", query_spec: {"calculations":[{"op":"COUNT"
                             }],"filters":[{"column":"error","op":"=","value":true},{"col
                             umn":"http.route","op":"=","value":"/shopping-list/generate"
                             }],"time_range":604800,"limit":1}, output_format: "json",
                             include_samples: true)
  ⎿  {                                                                              
       "success": true,
       "message": "Query executed successfully",
     … +615 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I can see sample error events. Let me grab a trace ID and show you how to
  visualize the full distributed trace across all your services:

⏺ honeycomb - get_trace (MCP)(environment_slug: "obs-playground", trace_id:
                             "6055b20e9e5b98444a40cd68c54d0c22", view_mode: "auto")
  ⎿ # environment: obs-playground | error_count: 7 | error_rate: 41.2% | max_spans_l
    imit: 100 | navigation_hints: [Small trace. Use 'full' mode to see all details.
    Errors detected. Look for spans with error=true or status_code=ERROR for investi
    … +55 lines (ctrl+o to expand)



⏺ Excellent! This shows the complete distributed trace across all 3 services:

  Trace Flow:
  1. nextjs-app - Request enters (GET /shopping-list)
  2. nextjs-app → express-server - Fetch to /shopping-list/generate
  3. express-server → graphql-server - POST request to GraphQL
  4. graphql-server - GraphQL validation fails ⚠️
  5. Error propagates back through the entire chain

  Key Metrics:
  - Total duration: 38.2ms
  - Error rate: 41.2% (7 errors / 17 spans)
  - Services: nextjs-app (10 spans), express-server (4 spans), graphql-server (3
  spans)
  - View in UI: https://ui.honeycomb.io/polymer-technologies/environments/obs-playgro
  und/trace?trace_id=6055b20e9e5b98444a40cd68c54d0c22&trace_start_ts=1761107745&trace
  _end_ts=1761712545

  Now let me show you the find_columns tool, which helps discover relevant columns
  before building queries:

⏺ honeycomb - find_columns (MCP)(environment_slug: "obs-playground", input: "performance
                                latency response time")
  ⎿ # Page: 1 | Items per page: 50 | Total items: 50 | Total pages: 1 | Has next pag
    e: false | Has previous page: false | Dataset:  | Environment: obs-playground |
    FindInput: performance latency response time
    … +53 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


⏺ Great! The find_columns tool uses semantic search to discover relevant columns. It
  found:
  - duration_ms (the primary latency metric)
  - http.response_time
  - Various percentile metrics from the unknown_metrics dataset
  - Recipe timing fields (prep_time, cook_time, total_time)

  Finally, let me show you find_queries - it searches through your query history to
  find similar queries:

⏺ honeycomb - find_queries (MCP)(environment_slug: "obs-playground", input: "shopping
                                list errors failures", max_queries: 5)
  ⎿ ┌────────────────┬─────────────┬───────────────┬──────┬──────────────┬──────────
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    … +121 lines (ctrl+o to expand)




⏺ Perfect! It found 5 queries from your history including ones looking for errors and
   telemetry data. You can use the query_run_pk values (like o34wTts84ut) with
  get_query_results to fetch the actual results.

  Summary - What We've Explored

  Here's what the Honeycomb MCP tools enable:

  1. Discovery (get_workspace_context, get_environment, get_dataset_columns)
  - Understand your team's data structure before querying
  - See available datasets and their columns

  2. Search (find_columns, find_queries)
  - Semantic search to discover relevant columns
  - Find previously run queries matching your intent

  3. Querying (run_query, get_query_results)
  - Time-series aggregations with breakdowns
  - Filters, calculations (COUNT, AVG, percentiles)
  - Business metrics alongside standard OTEL data
  - Both ASCII visualizations and JSON output

  4. Trace Analysis (get_trace)
  - View complete distributed traces across services
  - Multiple view modes (auto, compact, full, focused)
  - Shows error propagation and service dependencies

  5. Anomaly Detection (run_bubbleup)
  - Identifies what makes a subset different from baseline
  - Statistical analysis across all columns

  6. Boards & Alerts (list_boards, create_board, get_triggers)
  - Manage dashboards and alert configurations

  The tools give you programmatic access to all your observability data with the
  flexibility to build custom queries, analyze traces, and discover patterns!

> lets look into that graphql validation failure 

⏺ Great idea! Let's investigate that GraphQL validation failure. First, let me query
  the graphql-server dataset to see what validation errors are occurring:

⏺ honeycomb - run_query (MCP)(environment_slug: "obs-playground", dataset_slug:
                             "graphql-server", query_spec: {"calculations":[{"op":"COUNT"
                             }],"filters":[{"column":"error","op":"=","value":true}],"bre
                             akdowns":["name"],"time_range":604800,"limit":10},
                             output_format: "ascii")
  ⎿  ┌───────┬──────────────────┐                                                   
     │ COUNT │ name             │
     ├───────┼──────────────────┤
     … +104 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I can see 16 errors in graphql.validate spans. Let me get samples to see the actual
   validation error messages:

⏺ honeycomb - run_query (MCP)(environment_slug: "obs-playground", dataset_slug:
                             "graphql-server", query_spec:
                             {"calculations":[{"op":"COUNT"}],"filters":[{"column":"name"
                             ,"op":"=","value":"graphql.validate"},{"column":"error","op"
                             :"=","value":true}],"time_range":604800}, output_format:
                             "json", include_samples: true)
  ⎿  {                                                                              
       "success": true,
       "message": "Query executed successfully",
     … +481 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Excellent! I found the issue. All 16 validation errors have the exact same message:

  "Variable $ids is never used in operation GetRecipes."

  This is a GraphQL validation error where a variable $ids is declared in the
  operation signature but never used in the actual query body. Let me search the
  codebase to find where this malformed query is being sent:

⏺ Search(pattern: "GetRecipes", path: "apps/express-server", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Search(pattern: "\$ids", path: "apps/express-server", output_mode: "content")

⏺ Search(pattern: "GetRecipes", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 31 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Let me look at one of the error traces more carefully to see if there are any
  attributes showing the actual GraphQL query being sent:

⏺ honeycomb - get_trace (MCP)(environment_slug: "obs-playground", trace_id:
                             "6055b20e9e5b98444a40cd68c54d0c22", view_mode: "full",

⏺ Let me check the graphql-server to see if there are any GraphQL queries stored or
  cached there:

⏺ Search(pattern: "GetRecipes|ids", path: "apps/graphql-server", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 25 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Let me search more broadly across all apps for this specific query pattern:

⏺ Search(pattern: "query GetRecipes[^A-Za-z]", output_mode: "content")

  ⎿    }                                        

       // Call GraphQL to get recipe ingredients
     … +23 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Here's what the Honeycomb investigation revealed:

  The Bug

  Before the refactor (commit d6f1f38~1), the Express server had this malformed
  GraphQL query:

  query GetRecipes($ids: [ID!]!) {
    recipes: recipes {
      id
      title
      ingredients { ... }
    }
  }

  Problem: The query declares a variable $ids in the operation signature but never 
  uses it in the query body. GraphQL validation correctly rejects this as an error.

  After the refactor (commit d6f1f38 on Oct 27), it was fixed to:

  query GetAllRecipes {
    recipes {
      id
      title
      ingredients { ... }
    }
  }

  The unused variable was removed, fixing the validation error.

  What Honeycomb Showed Us

  Using the Honeycomb MCP tools, we were able to:

  1. Identify the error pattern - 16 identical GraphQL validation errors
  2. Extract the error message - "Variable $ids is never used in operation
  GetRecipes"
  3. See the distributed trace - Traced the error from Next.js → Express → GraphQL
  server
  4. Pinpoint the timing - Errors occurred Oct 26-27, right before the refactor
  5. Understand the impact - Shopping list generation was failing with 400 errors

  This is a perfect example of how observability helps you:
  - Validate refactors - The telemetry data confirms the Oct 27 refactor fixed the
  issue
  - Understand historical issues - Even though the bug is fixed in the code, you can
  still see when it happened and its impact
  - Root cause analysis - The distributed traces showed exactly where the validation
  failure occurred in the service chain

  The errors you're seeing in Honeycomb are historical - from before the fix. The
  current code is correct!
